Hello World!

I am currently working on the foundations of The Odin Project,
and this is my first project. I am currently learning html, and 
am working on creating a website that has a index page that will
have links to a few recipes.

Some skills that I will demonstrate, are utilizing the html basic 
boilerplate to begin the project, creating unordered and ordered 
lists, and linking pages together.

These will be some delightful recipes from the World of Harry Potter!

I am looking forward to learning much more!
