Hello World!

I am currently working on the foundations of The Odin Project,
and this is my first project. I am currently learning html, and 
am working on creating a website that has a index page that will
have links to a few recipes.

Some skills that I will demonstrate, are utilizing the html basic 
boilerplate to begin the project, creating unordered and ordered 
lists, and linking pages together.

I am a current coffee professional, so I look forward to utilizing
what I am learning to share more about my current profession and
passion. For this first html project, I will share a few coffee
pourover recipes.

I am looking forward to learning much more!
