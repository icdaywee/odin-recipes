    <h2>What you'll need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hario V60 Ceramic Coffee Dripper</li>
            <li>Hario v60 Paper Coffee Filter</li>
            <li>30g Coffee: Ground medium</li>
            <li>Coffee server</li>
            <li>Gooseneck Kettle</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Scale</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Set-Up</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by filling up your kettle and setting it to boil.</li>
            <li>Rinse the paper filter with the now boiled water, ensuring that it is 
                fully saturated.</li>
            <li>Grind your 30g of coffee to a medium consistency.</li>
            <li>Position your V60 coffee dripper on top of your coffee server. 
                Ensure that the server will hold more than 500g of coffee to avoid a spill.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Brew Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 30g of ground coffee to the V60. With your finger, create a small 
                well in the middle of the grounds.</li>
            <li>Start the timer and add 60g of water to bloom the coffee. Pick up and
                 swirl the coffee 5 times.</li>
            <li>At the 45 second mark, continue pouring until the scale reads 300g. 
                Aim to complete this pour within 30 seconds, finishing at the 1:15 mark. 
                (Hoffman recommends a flow rate of 8g per second if possible.)</li>
            <li>At the 1:15 minute mark, complete the pour by pouring until the scale reads 500g.</li>
            <li>At the 1:45 minute mark, use the spoon to stir once clockwise and once anti-clockwise, 
                knocking off the grounds from the sides of the V60.</li>
            <li>After letting the V60 drain a little, give it 3 more swirls.</li>
            <li>Allow the water to drip through the grounds entirely, 
                ideally finishing by the 3:30 mark. Remove the filter and serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
