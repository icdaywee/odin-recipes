        <ol>
            <li>Start by filling up your kettle and setting it to boil.</li>
            <li>Put a filter in the Kalita Wave, and place on top of a server.</li>
            <li>Pour hot water from kettle and rinse filter until you feel heat on the outside of the Kalita, and then discard water</li>
            <li>Add 30g of medium course ground coffee to the Kalita wave. Shake to level the coffee bed and zero the scale</li>
            <li>Start the timer on the scale and start your pour at the same time.</li>
            <li>Pouring is split into six separate pours of 65g of water in 15 seconds*, and allowing to drain for 15 seconds in between each pour</li>
            <li>Start each pour in the center. Work your way out and then back to the center, in concentric circles, saturating any dark spots of coffee on the surface.</li>
            <li>Coffee should finish draining around 3:30. Remove the Kalita Wave. Serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
